# Azure Key Vault Project

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the secure management of secrets, keys, and certificates using Azure Key Vault. It covers the complete process of creating, configuring, and using Azure Key Vault to enhance the security of sensitive information in Azure cloud environments.

## Project Objectives

* Securely store and manage secrets, keys, and certificates.
* Control access to sensitive data using Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
* Integrate Key Vault with Azure services, including Web Apps and Virtual Machines.
* Automate secret management using Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell.

## Project Components

* **Azure Key Vault:** Centralized secure store for secrets, keys, and certificates.
* **Azure CLI and PowerShell:** Tools for managing Key Vault programmatically.
* **Azure RBAC:** Access control for secure Key Vault management.

## Prerequisites

* Azure account with appropriate permissions.
* Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell installed.
* Basic understanding of Azure services.

## Project Architecture

1. **Create Azure Key Vault:** Establish a secure vault to store sensitive information.
2. **Configure Access Policies:** Grant or restrict access to users or applications using Azure RBAC.
3. **Store Secrets and Keys:** Add secrets, keys, and certificates to the vault.
4. **Access Control:** Use Azure Managed Identity or service principals for secure access.
5. **Integration:** Connect Key Vault with Azure services like Web Apps, VMs, and Logic Apps.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Create Azure Key Vault

* Use Azure Portal, CLI, or PowerShell to create the Key Vault.
* Define the Key Vaultâ€™s region and pricing tier.

### 2. Configure Access Policies

* Set permissions for users, groups, or applications.
* Use Azure RBAC for fine-grained access control.

### 3. Store Secrets and Keys

* Add secrets (passwords, API keys) to the vault.
* Store encryption keys or SSL certificates.

### 4. Secure Access Using Managed Identity

* Enable managed identity on Azure services (e.g., App Service) to access Key Vault.

### 5. Automate with Azure CLI and PowerShell

* Automate secret management and access using CLI commands or PowerShell scripts.

## Best Practices

* Regularly rotate secrets and keys.
* Restrict access using RBAC with the principle of least privilege.
* Monitor Key Vault access using Azure Monitor.

## Troubleshooting

* Ensure proper access policies for users and applications.
* Use Azure Monitor to track access and alerts.
* Verify that the Managed Identity has sufficient permissions.

## Project Conclusion

This project demonstrates secure secret management using Azure Key Vault, covering creation, access control, and integration with Azure services. It provides a robust solution for securing sensitive information in the cloud.
